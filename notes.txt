ROADMAP
- implement 'all' common features of a calculator
- multiline statements including variables
- implement 'all' functions from python math module
- multiple cells (first time kind of a notebook feel)
- now we need to finally make a 'complete' text editor (highlighting, copy, paste, ...)

TODO
- test record feature
- for which values functions like sqrt, log are defined (needs to be checked)

BUGS
- double !
- right shift enter not working
