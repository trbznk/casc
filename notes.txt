TODO:

arena allocator
- malloc one fixed-big chunk of memory with malloc
- using your own malloc if you need memory
- use your allocated arena to give memory then
- the basic idea is to malloc one arena per task
- after the task is done it's possible to free all memory related
  to the task very easily
- so in this case we dont need to free single ASTNodes and similar things
  like ast_match and so on.
